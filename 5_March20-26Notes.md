**Wordpress sucks**
I don't like it. It doesn't make any sense,
None of the links that I've tried to link seem to want to work. I thought I had figured it out, but what worked on a button and a section of text suddenly didn't work on the navigation menu!
I imagine it's just like other technology things and you have to learn a framework. But I don't immmediately see the logic in it.
