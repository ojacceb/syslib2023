# Troubleshooting Problems:
## Footer on wordpress sub pages (not home page) wont delete...

- Googled "remove footer from Wordpress page", the first hit 
https://thewebsitearchitect.com/wordpress-remove-header-and-footer-from-a-single-page/ suggested checking the theme settings. I was able to figure out how to navigate to the theme settings and delete all but the copyright & tag at the bottom. saved it and it seemed to update on all my webpages. 


## Working on meshing wordpress page w/ Omeka & Koha pages

- chose very simple theme (deleted the theme that was giving me trouble with the footers)
- simple theme (so far) is easier to modify and edit. 
- It still is not intuitive to modify. For example, I'm trying to create two columns with title, photo and navigation button. You whould think the theme would automatically allow you to adjust the placement of objects to align logically, but it doesn't seem to want to do that with the buttons. It worked well for the headding and the photos though. 
- I linked a header text to another page. And got the two nagivation buttons to link to the koha and omeka pages.
- Next time I need to work on cleaning up the homepage (Wordpress) and getting the Omeka theme to match as much as possible. 

## 4/20 working on matching themes between Wordpress & Omeka
- problem: changing the theme in Omeka. when I browsed themes and selected a new one, it downloaded a zip file to my computer. I didn't remember how I adjusted the  theme the first time I selected one.
- In the documentation instructions for Omeka, they give instructions for changing a theme involving an FTP client. (1) I haven't used one of those and (2) I think it would be complicated to use one because my Omeka is hosted on a virtual machine. 
- I googled "install Omeka theme using linux command line" and didn't get any helpful results. I also searched the Omeka documentation for the word "terminal, command line" etc and couldn't find instructions there. 
- I deicded to try to poke around the omeka file on my server to see if I can find anything there related to my theme
- I was able to navigate to the `themes` directory on my server. it's patway is `/var/www/html/omeka/themes` inside there are the berlin, default and seasons themes. I believe I downloaded the berlin one.
- next step is to see if I can get a pathway online to minimalist theme that I want to add to this directory. Then I can unzip it and hopefully activate it (per the documentation instructions) using the web interface.
- good news! The minimalist theme has a githup repo! So if I can remember how we pulled a compressed file from the gitup repo to our VMs I might be in business!
- I used these instructions to clone the theme repo to my themes directory https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/cloning-a-repository
- I had to run the command as sudo `sudo git clone https://etc...`
- the directory `theme-minimalist` appeared in the themes directory. 
- now I'll go back to the Omeka instructions to see what they said to do after using the FTP client to upload the zip file
- The Omeka documentation said to open the "themes" tab of the omeka admin site and the new theme should apear there.  
- It did!!!!
