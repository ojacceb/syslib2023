# Troubleshooting Problems:
## Footer on wordpress sub pages (not home page) wont delete...

- Googled "remove footer from Wordpress page", the first hit 
https://thewebsitearchitect.com/wordpress-remove-header-and-footer-from-a-single-page/ suggested checking the theme settings. I was able to figure out how to navigate to the theme settings and delete all but the copyright & tag at the bottom. saved it and it seemed to update on all my webpages. 


## Working on meshing wordpress page w/ Omeka & Koha pages

- chose very simple theme (deleted the theme that was giving me trouble with the footers)
- simple theme (so far) is easier to modify and edit. 
- It still is not intuitive to modify. For example, I'm trying to create two columns with title, photo and navigation button. You whould think the theme would automatically allow you to adjust the placement of objects to align logically, but it doesn't seem to want to do that with the buttons. It worked well for the headding and the photos though. 
- I linked a header text to another page. And got the two nagivation buttons to link to the koha and omeka pages.
- Next time I need to work on cleaning up the homepage (Wordpress) and getting the Omeka theme to match as much as possible.
